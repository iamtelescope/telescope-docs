title: Development environment setup for Telescope
description: TODO
---


## Architecture Overview

Telescope has a straightforward architecture, consisting of:

- A **backend** written in Python using Django.
- A **frontend** written in JavaScript using Vue.js.

After building and assembling the application, we have a single Django-based app that serves the static files, where the JavaScript application runs

### Role of Django application

Django app serves as the web server responsible for:

- Managing authentication.
- Handling database interactions.
- Handling frontend static files.

Since `index.html` is served through Django app, the user is authenticated before accessing the JavaScript application. This allows Django to enforce authentication at the entry point.

- **Login and logout UI**: Handled by Django.
- **Rest of the UI**: Implemented in Vue.js.
- **UI API**: Django acts as a backend-for-frontend (BFF), serving as an API for the Vue.js frontend using session cookies for authentication. A separate API for automated (robot) access is planned for the future.
- **Database**: Django supports any database compatible with its ORM (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL).

## Development Workflow

The development process consists of two independent stages:

1. **Backend Development**: Django can be developed separately without running the frontend.
2. **Frontend Development**: Requires the Django development server to be running.

### Prerequisites

To set up the development environment, you need:

- **Python 3.12++**
- **Node.js 20++**

Each OS (Windows, macOS, Linux) has slightly different setup instructions, so refer to their respective official documentation for installation details.

### Setting Up the Environment

#### 1. Setting up Python Environment

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd ./backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### 2. Setting up Node.js Environment

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd ./ui
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Development Servers

### 0. Prepare configuration file
You can start configuring the application using the `dev/config.yaml` file.
For other configuration options, please refer to the [documentation](config.md).

### 1. Running Django Development Server

If this is your first launch, you will need to run the migration step (or if you have made changes to the models).
```sh
cd ./backend
export TELESCOPE_CONFIG_FILE=${HOME}/.telescope/config.yaml
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### 2. Running Vue.js Development Server

Navigate to the frontend directory and run:

```sh
cd ui
npm run serve
```

### 3. Initial Authentication Step

Before using the frontend, you must log in via the Django server once. This is necessary to obtain a valid session cookie on `localhost`. Without this step, the Vue.js application won't be able to access the API due to missing authentication.

1. Open the Django server in a browser (`http://localhost:8000`).
2. Log in using your credentials.
3. Once logged in, you can start using the Vue.js application (`http://localhost:8080`).

#### Note on Static Files in Django

By default, the Django backend serves static files that are generated using NPM. On a fresh repository clone, these static files will be missing from the backend directory. As a result, after logging in, you may encounter an error:

```
TemplateDoesNotExist at /
index.html
```

This error does not prevent the authentication process from completing successfully. The session cookie will still be set, allowing you to proceed with frontend development on `http://localhost:8080`.

However, if you need to verify static file rendering within the Django application or simply want to avoid this error, you must rebuild the backend's static files. To do this:

1. Activate the virtual environment for the Django backend and set the required ENV var for the telescope config.
2. Run the provided script to rebuild the static files (located in repository root):

   ```bash
   ./rebuild_static.bash
   ```

This script will trigger `npm run build` and `./manage.py collectstatic`, which requires the correct Django configuration to initialize properly.
