A Source is an object that defines connection parameters for an external data source, such as a database, API, or file. It also specifies which fields from the given source should be used and how.

Additionally, a source acts as an RBAC entity, allowing roles to be assigned to users and groups.

Currently, only ClickHouse sources are supported. The [clickhouse-driver](https://clickhouse-driver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) python library is used for connecting and executing queries.
