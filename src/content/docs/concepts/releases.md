description: Learn about Telescope's versioning approach, how updates are structured, and what to expect from each release.
---

Telescope **attempts to follow** a **three-number versioning scheme** (`X.Y.Z`) based on **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**, but exceptions may occur at the discretion of the developers.

- **X (Major)** – Significant updates with breaking changes.
- **Y (Minor)** – New features, fully backward-compatible.
- **Z (Patch)** – Bug fixes and small improvements.

Before `1.0.0`, versions (`0.Y.Z`) indicate an evolving system where breaking changes may still happen.
