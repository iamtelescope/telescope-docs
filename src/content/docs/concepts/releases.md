During the beta stage, the version number monotonously grows in the third number (e.g., `0.0.1`, `0.0.2`, `0.0.3`, etc.).

Starting from version `1.0.0`, Telescope will follow a **three-number versioning scheme** (`X.Y.Z`) based on **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**:

- **X (Major)** – Significant updates with breaking changes.
- **Y (Minor)** – New features, fully backward-compatible.
- **Z (Patch)** – Bug fixes and small improvements.
